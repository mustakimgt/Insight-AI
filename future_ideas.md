# Future Feature Ideas for insight.ai

Here are several high-impact features we could implement to elevate the dashboard to the next level.

## 1. AI-Powered Intelligence
- **"Ask Your Data" Chatbot**: A conversational interface where users can ask questions like "Why did sentiment drop on Amazon last week?" or "Summarize the top complaints about battery life."
- **Sentiment Forecasting**: Use historical data to predict future sentiment trends and warn about potential PR crises.
- **Automated Root Cause Analysis**: AI that automatically correlates negative reviews with specific product updates or batches.

## 2. Advanced Analytics & Visualization
- **Geographic Heatmap**: Visualize where reviews are coming from to identify regional issues (e.g., shipping delays in a specific state).
- **Competitor Benchmarking**: A view to compare the user's product metrics directly against key competitors.
- **Word Trees**: Interactive visualization to explore how specific words (like "battery" or "screen") are used in context.

## 3. Workflow & Collaboration
- **Ticket System Integration**: One-click integration to create Jira, Linear, or Trello tickets directly from critical issues or negative reviews.
- **Team Annotations**: Allow team members to add comments or notes directly on charts (e.g., "Marketing campaign started here") to explain spikes or drops.
- **Smart Alerts**: Configurable notifications (Email/Slack) when sentiment drops below a threshold or a new critical issue emerges.

## 4. Customization & Reporting
- **Customizable Dashboard**: Drag-and-drop widget system allowing users to build their own personalized overview page.
- **Automated Weekly Reports**: Generate and email beautiful PDF summaries of the week's performance to stakeholders.
- **Saved Filter Views**: Allow users to save complex filter combinations (e.g., "Negative Amazon Reviews about Battery") for quick access.

## 5. Data Management
- **CSV/Excel Import**: Allow users to upload their own historical data files.
- **Live API Connectors**: Real integrations with Amazon Seller Central, Shopify, Google Play Console, and App Store Connect.

## 6. Enterprise & Sales-Driving AI Features (The "Wow" Factor)
These features are designed to directly impact revenue and speed, making the tool a "must-have" for product teams.

- **AI Persona Focus Groups**:
    - *Concept*: Generate AI personas based on your actual user segments (e.g., "Angry Power User", "Confused Newbie").
    - *Value*: Product managers can "chat" with these personas to test feature ideas instantly without scheduling real user interviews.
- **Revenue Impact Modeling**:
    - *Concept*: AI correlates specific complaints (e.g., "checkout bug") with churned accounts to calculate the exact dollar cost of ignoring an issue.
    - *Value*: "Fixing this bug will save you estimated $50k/month in churn." – The ultimate sales pitch for engineering resources.
- **Competitor "Gap Hunter"**:
    - *Concept*: AI monitors competitor reviews to identify *their* specific weaknesses and suggests features you can build to steal their unhappy customers.
    - *Value*: Turns competitor failures into your product roadmap.
- **Automated PRD Generator**:
    - *Concept*: One-click generation of detailed Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) from a cluster of user feature requests.
    - *Value*: Saves Product Managers hours of writing specs.
- **"Pre-Churn" Intervention**:
    - *Concept*: Detect subtle changes in sentiment or specific phrases that indicate a user is about to cancel, and trigger an automated retention workflow (e.g., offer a discount or a call).
    - *Value*: Direct reduction in churn.
